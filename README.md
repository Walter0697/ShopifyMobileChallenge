### Required feature:
- Listview that show product image, title and description
- Extra 1: detailed information after tapping the product
- Extra 2: Search capabilities to the app

### Additional features (that are not in the requirement):
- next page and previous page
- changing scroll bar and app icon

### What and how and why?
#### Searching:
- I kept comparing the keyword with the product information such as title and tags, if it is a match, then I will return this product to the list
#### Pages:
- User cannot click next page when the page is empty, because they already reached to the end of the product lists
- Instructure mentioned that I can ignore additional pages but I feel like I should complete the app if I am able to finish it
#### Icon:
- I change the app and scroll bar icon into shopify icon because it will look nicer.
